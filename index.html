<P>Hi. My name is Andrea. And this is the first HTML page I have ever created.

<P>In this page I will post links to short work reports produced during my study of mathematics and data science. Meanwhile, you may find me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pigkappa">Facebook</a>, <a href="https://uk.linkedin.com/in/andreacaleo">Linkedin</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/andreacaleo">GitHub</a>.
